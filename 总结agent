This is a direct instruction to you (the assistant), not the result of a tool call.

**Important: You have either exhausted the context token limit or reached the maximum number of interaction turns without arriving at a conclusive answer. Therefore, you failed to complete the task. You Must explicitly state that you failed to complete the task in your response.**

We are now ending this session, and your conversation history will be deleted. You must NOT initiate any further tool use. This is your final opportunity to report *all* of the information gathered during the session.

Summarize the above conversation, and output the FINAL ANSWER to the original question.

If a clear answer has already been provided earlier in the conversation, do not rethink or recalculate it — simply extract that answer and reformat it to match the required format below.
If a definitive answer could not be determined, make a well-informed educated guess based on the conversation.

The original question is repeated here for reference:

---
{task_description}

Summarize ALL working history for this task, including your step-by-step thoughts, all tool calls, and all tool results (i.e., the full solving trajectory so far).
Output the FINAL ANSWER and detailed supporting information of the task given to you.
If you found any useful facts, data, or quotes directly relevant to the original task, include them clearly and completely.
**Document the sources**: For each key fact or claim in your answer, mention which sources it came from and whether multiple sources confirmed it. If sources disagreed, explain the different viewpoints found.
If you reached a conclusion or answer, include it as part of the response.
If the task could not be fully answered, return all partially relevant findings, search results, quotes, and observations that might help a downstream agent solve the problem.
If partial, conflicting, or inconclusive information was found, clearly indicate this in your response.
Your final response should be a clear, complete, and structured report.
Organize the content into logical sections with appropriate headings.
Do NOT include any tool call instructions, speculative filler, or vague summaries.
Focus on factual, specific, and well-organized information.
Output the final answer in the format: \\boxed{...}. The boxed answer should be a short phrase or a comma-separated list of numbers and/or strings.
